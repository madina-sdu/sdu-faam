        <h4 class="news__title"><b>Dear, readers.</b> <br><br></h4>
        <p class="news__text">
          The only truth in our lives that is beyond change is the fact of continuous change. Some things become out of date, some things proliferate and some things develop and ameliorate. There happen other changes whatsoever indeed. However, human being's change, despite ocassional unfavorable trend, has always occurred for the better and finer. Perhaps we believe in it being that way. For, we conceive that whoever sees righteously thinks righteously, and whoever thinks righteously derives enjoyment from life.By virtue of it, the mental acceptance may be preparing us to have a more positive outlook on life and being more hopeful of life. Thereby, bodily and mental approach makes individuals happier and more zealous and communities more productive and successful. <br><br>
          These days we conduct the celebrations of the 20th anniversary of Kazakhstan's independence. Along with these celebrations, experiencing the pride and joy of completing its 15th year, our university is participating in them more proudly, joyously and excitingly. We are happy because we are an institution that is to have completed its 15th year in a country celebrating its 20th anniversary. We are proud because, feeling the support and help of students and teachers, generous sponsors who have devoted their lives to educating and governmental bodies, we have moved to a modern university campus. We are excited because what we have achieved is relatively small in regard to what we aspire to achieve. With its original and sophisticated architectural design, education and tutorial techniques that are up to the pedagogic norms, intelligent and diligent students and never tiring altruistic faculty we will always change for the better.<br><br>
          Our university will do its outmost to become an organisation to represent and identify the common sense, cooperation, international experience, dynamism and development. Launching an educational institution is an act of establishing the apropriate medium. The individuals penetrating that medium are to feel having entered a different atmosphere and a change of climate. Starting from the upcoming academic session, we will continue to change and advance in terms of academic, housing, extracurricular, socio-cultural and sports facilities. Yet, buildings and facilities do not make universities. An element that makes it a university, a functional one and will actually enliven it is solely its students. A student being intelligent, assiduous, physically and mentallyhealthy, patriotic,devoted to his/her family, community and culture is an essential component and the ground for the existence of this university. Wishing good luck with developing our new campus with a view to a concept that we defined as a Smart Campus, I hope that student's thrive for knowledge and success, and faculty's dilligence, altruism and happiness would boost as ever. <br><br>
